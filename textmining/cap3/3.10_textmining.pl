#As noted in problem 2.9.b, at present, there are plenty of DNA sequences available to the public 
#at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at its Web page: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ [81].

#Since DNA is text (though its words and grammar are mostly unknown), it makes sense to use Perl and 
#regexes to analyze DNA, which is exactly the point made in Perl for Exploring DNA by Mark LeBlanc 
#and Betsey Dexter Dyer [70]. Note that these authors also enjoy word games, and they introduce the
# idea of text patterns in DNA by analyzing letter patterns in English words.
# Even without a background in biology, the book is quite readable, and I recommend it.

#For this problem, get a copy of LeBlanc and Dyer’s book and see how they use Perl for DNA pattern finding.
# With the data of the NCBI, perhaps you can discover something notable.
