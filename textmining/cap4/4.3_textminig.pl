# [Requires a statistical package] Output 4.2 gives the frequencies of the 
# letters appearing in the fictional works A Christmas Carol and “The Black Cat.”
# For this problem, focus on the former. The ranks of the letters in A Christmas 
# Carol are easy to assign since these values are already in numerical order; 
# that is, the letter on the first line (e) has rank 1, the letter on the second line (t)
# has rank 2, and so forth. Using a statistical package such as R,
# make a plot of the Log(Rank) vs. Log(Frequency) for the 26 letters.
# How does this compare to figure 3.1? In your opinion, how well does Zipf’s law hold for letters?
